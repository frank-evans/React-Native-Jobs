# Tech Team Up

## Description

I thought it would be fun to learn how to make a mobile app that could also help me team up with an awesome group.
This is a mobile application with cross-platform code for desktop that enables users to do an advanced search for company team openings, view detailed position information, and locate available positions based on their current location.

## Usage

This build was designed for my personal use, however the Custom Search will allow you to search based on specific profession and location.  Once you find an interesting team you can click the Apply button to go directly to the company listing to contact them there.
